# Flutter

Java development environment for [Toolbox](containertoolbx.org/)

## Usage

after you created the toolbox with this image, you can enter the environment by running

```bash
toolbox enter <container-name>
```

    It is recommended that you run `flutter doctor` the first time you enter the container to check if all requirements for flutter development are fulfilled (The first time may take a while).
