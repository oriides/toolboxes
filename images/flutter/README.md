# Flutter

Flutter development environment for [Toolbox](https://containertoolbx.org/)

## Usage

after you created the toolbox with this image, you can enter the environment by running

```bash
toolbox enter <container-name>
```

> [!NOTE]
> It is recommended that you run `flutter doctor` the first time you enter the container to check if all requirements for flutter development are fulfilled (The first time may take a while).

## Image details

This image contains the flutter and android SDKs downloaded from the official sources. Unfortunately the versions of these SDKs need to be kept up-to-date manually.
